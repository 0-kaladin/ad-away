# AdAway

AdAway is an open source ad blocker for Android using the hosts file. 

For more information visit http://code.google.com/p/ad-away/

# Build AdAway

1. Have Android SDK and NDK in your PATH
2. Execute ``android update project -p .`` in ``AdAway`` and ``AdAway/android-libs/ActionBarSherlock`` and ``AdAway/android-libs/Donations``
3. Execute ``ndk-build`` in ``AdAway`` to compile native binaries.
4. Execute ``ant clear``
5. Execute ``ant debug -Ddonations=all`` or ``ant release -Ddonations=all``

## More build information

* It is necessary to build AdAway with Ant, because we use custom_rules.xml (For more information see https://github.com/dschuermann/root-commands#binaries)
* To disable Flattr and PayPal (not allowed in Google Play), execute ``ant debug -Ddonations=google``
* To disable Google (only working when the apk is signed with my private key), execute ``ant debug -Ddonations=other``

# Contribute

Fork AdAway and do a Pull Request. I will merge your changes back into the main project.

# Libraries

# AdAway/jni

Forked from the following sources and slightly modified to compile!

* dnsmasq:  https://github.com/CyanogenMod/android_external_dnsmasq
* libpcap: https://github.com/CyanogenMod/android_external_libpcap
* tcpdump: https://github.com/CyanogenMod/android_external_tcpdump

## Changes

``dnsmasq/source/src/Android.mk`` add following line:
```
LOCAL_LDLIBS := -llog
```

``tcpdump/Android.mk``:
```
LOCAL_C_INCLUDES += \
	$(LOCAL_PATH)/missing\
	$(LOCAL_PATH)/../libpcap

# disabled crypo libs, not needed in AdAway
#	$(LOCAL_PATH)/../openssl/include\

#LOCAL_SHARED_LIBRARIES += libssl libcrypto
```

``tcpdump/config.h``:
```
/* Whether or not to include the possibly-buggy SMB printer */
/* #undef TCPDUMP_DO_SMB */

/* Define to 1 if you have the <openssl/evp.h> header file. */
/* #undef HAVE_OPENSSL_EVP_H */

/* Define to 1 if you have the `crypto' library (-lcrypto). */
/* #undef HAVE_LIBCRYPTO */
```

# Update.zip

THIS IS CURRENTLY NOT WORKING!

Execute ./create_update_zip.sh to create update.zip files to work around S-ON.

This works by creating a symlink from /system/etc/hosts to /data/data/hosts

Info:
Clockwordmod Recovery < 3 uses Amend Scripting language, > 3 uses Edify
